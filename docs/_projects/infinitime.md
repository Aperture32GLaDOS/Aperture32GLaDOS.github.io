In this project, I implemented a general pride flag watchface for the open source [infinitime](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime) OS for the pinetime smart watch.

In this, I created a pull request and engaged in typical software development, involving some discussion as to how certain features would be best implemented. For full details, visit the pull request itself. This project demonstrates my capabilities of writing high-quality, industry-level C++ code, as well as my ability to work with others.
