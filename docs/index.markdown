Hi! I'm Eshe Hinchliffe, a trans woman with a passion for quality programming. I have experience in many programming languages, including (but not limited to): Rust, C/C++, Python, Java, and Ruby. I'm currently studying at the University of Sheffield for a master's degree in computer science (MComp). For more information on my projects, view [here](/projects).
