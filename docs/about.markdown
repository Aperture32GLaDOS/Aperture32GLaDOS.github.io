As mentioned in the homepage, I am a trans woman programmer. In this section, I aim to describe myself a bit more, including what I'd want from a job.

# About Me
I'm a northern girl, born in Leeds, raised in Sheffield. I have always enjoyed programming, and computing in general. I particularly enjoy low-level programming, in languages such as C and rust - I enjoy the added control, and the feeling of programming "down at the metal".
My biggest weakness would be my sense of style - I've never been good at frontend development, and although I *can* do it, I am far better suited to a backend position.
# What I Want
I want a job which will provide me with interesting problems to solve, and the tools to solve them. Some of my ideal jobs would include shader programming, systems programming, or API development. However, I am capable of much more.
It's also very important to me that my job will not interfere with my identity - the workplace *must* be inclusive and accepting, otherwise I won't be able to provide my best work.
