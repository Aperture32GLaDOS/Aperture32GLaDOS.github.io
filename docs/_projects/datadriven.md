In this project, which I completed for a university assignment, I created a python program which classifies chess pieces from images.

For this assignment, we were given two programs to create: one which is only given individual parts of the chess board, and another which is given the whole board. I implemented a novel technique, which used the KNN algorithm with a distance measure which included the probability of a piece being observed at a certain position into account - this technique increased the accuracy significantly.
