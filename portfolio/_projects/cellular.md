In this project (which was my dissertation), I created software in C++ to simulate heart tissue using cellular automata. In this project, speed was the main focus.

I used several advanced techniques in achieving performance, such as an application of the FFT, usage of SIMD intrinsics, and safe multithreading by way of mutexes. This project demonstrates my capability to write fast C++ code.
