In this project, which I completed for a university assignment, I created a java program which uses the graphics library OpenGL to render a basic room, with a spacecraft-like feel.

This project demonstrates my proficiency with java, as well as my ability to write fairly low-level graphics code. Some shaders in this project are fairly advanced, such as a window which will only allow certain objects to be viewed through the window - otherwise, they are rendered as completely invisible. Also note the custom spotlight code (the code for the basic lighting engine was given to us, so I cannot take credit for it).
